# WP-Homestead

This project attempts to address issues of stability on Windows 10 with Vagrants built for Wordpress developers. It's nothing more than a few extra provisioning scripts built on top of Laravel's very stable and beautifully performant Vagrant [_Homestead_](https://laravel.com/docs/homestead).

## About Homestead

Because Homestead is so awesome already, this project doesn't mean to improve upon it. From Homesteads official `readme.md`:

> Homestead runs on any Windows, Mac, or Linux system, and includes the Nginx web server, PHP 7.1, MySQL, Postgres, Redis, Memcached, Node, and all of the other goodies you need to develop amazing Laravel applications.

To learn how homestead works & for all homestead related issues, you should check out the [official docs](https://laravel.com/docs/homestead).
